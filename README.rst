===================
Sliced imaging data
===================

Background
==========

If we want to store imaging data on the cloud and allow scientists to experiment with this data with interactive local tools (e.g., Jupyter notebooks), we should provide an easy interface to retrieve this data.  We should future-proof this model for extremely large images with multiple dimensions, where users may want to pull slices of this data without having to download the entire image.

Design
------

Images will be stored in a tiled format such that ranged requests can be used to efficiently fetch slices of the data.  Each set should be described in a manifest file indicating the constituent files and where in the n-dimensional space each tile represents.

There should be a python API that allows users to point at an image set, ranges across multiple dimensions, and yields the data in numpy format.  The python API should retrieve the table of contents, calculate the objects needed, fetch them in parallel, decode them, and slice out the data needed.

Locating a tile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The location for each tile is given in coordinates and indices.  Coordinates is the location of the tile in geometric
space, and indices is the location of the tile in non-geometric space.  Together, coordinates and indices resolve
exactly where the tile is in the n-dimensional space.

Format
------

Each image set should have a json document that serves as the table of contents (TOC).  The TOC can either enumerate a list of other TOCs (`TOC partition`_) or describe a list of tiles (`Image shard TOC`_).  The entire image set consists of all the tiles in all of the TOCs referenced by the top-level TOC, directly or indirectly.

TOC partition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TOC partitions should have the following fields:

===================  ======  ========  =================================================================================
Field Name           Type    Required  Description
-------------------  ------  --------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version              string  Yes       Semantic versioning of the file format.
tocs                 list    Yes       List of relative paths or URLs to other TOC files.
extras               dict    No        Additional application-specific payload.  The vocabulary and the schema are
                                       uncontrolled.

.. _`Image shard TOC`:

Image shard TOC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Image shard TOCs should have the following fields:

===================  ======  ========  =================================================================================
Field Name           Type    Required  Description
-------------------  ------  --------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version              string  Yes       Semantic versioning of the file format.
dimensions           list    Yes       Names of the dimensions.  Dimensions must include `x` and `y`.
tiles                dict    Yes       See Tiles_
shape                dict    Yes       Maps each non-geometric dimension to the possible number of values for that
                                       dimensions for the tiles in this `Image shard TOC`_.
default_tile_shape   tuple   No        Default pixel dimensions of a tile, ordered as x, y.
default_tile_format  string  No        Default file format of the tiles.
zoom                 dict    No        See Zoom_
extras               dict    No        Additional application-specific payload.  The vocabulary and the schema are
                                       uncontrolled.

Tiles
~~~~~

Each item in the tiles section describes a file:

============  ======  ========  ========================================================================================
Field Name    Type    Required  Description
------------  ------  --------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
file          string  Yes       Relative path to the file.
coordinates   dict    Yes       Maps one of the dimensions in geometric space, either `x`, `y`, or `z`, to either a
                                single dimension value, or a tuple specifying the range for that dimension.  The `x` and
                                `y` coordinates must be provided as ranges.   Each of the dimensions here must be
                                specified in the `Image shard TOC`_.
indices       dict    Yes       Maps one of the dimensions *not* in geometric space to either a single dimension value,
                                or a tuple specifying the range for that dimension.  Each of the dimensions here must be
                                specified in the `Image shard TOC`_.  The values of the indices must be non-negative
                                integers, and every value up to but not including the maximum specified in the `shape`
                                field of the `Image shard TOC`_ must be represented.
tile_shape    tuple   No        Pixel dimensions of a tile, ordered as x, y.  If this is not provided, it defaults to
                                `default_tile_shape` in the `Image shard TOC`_).  If neither is provided, the tile shape
                                is inferred from actual file.
tile_format   string  No        File format of the tile.  If this is not provided, it defaults to `default_tile_format`
                                in the `Image shard TOC`_).  If neither is provided, the tile format is inferred from
                                actual file.
sha256        string  No        SHA256 checksum of the tile data.

                                uncontrolled.
